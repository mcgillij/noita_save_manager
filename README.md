It will always create a backup in the Noita folder prior to restoring. So it won't overwrite / delete anything.

# Building from source

If you want to build your own binary/ source distribution / wheel, you can use the following steps. Uses **poetry** for dependency management.

poetry run pyinstaller -F --noconsole src/noita_save_manager/save_manager.py
```

This will plop out a binary for you in the `dist/` folder.
